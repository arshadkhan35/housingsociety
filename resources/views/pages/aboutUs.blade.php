  	<p>The About Us page does an excellent job of creating that magical and illustrious vibe. They use rich professional photographs and enticing copy like:
    “The six-time success at Le Mans has made Bentley more than a car – it has come to stand for a way of doing things: with spirit, flair, courage, instinctive intelligence and teamwork.”

The whole point of this About Us page is to get you to feel part of the experience. To draw you in to their way of thinking and acting which is, in fact, their marketing plan and branding. Remember that your About Us page often serves as a point of consolidation – the place where people go to put your whole vision together.</p>
